As someone from Hawaii, one of the most common questions I get is, “I’m visiting Hawaii—what should I do and see?” Below, I’ve shared some of my favorite recommendations for outdoor activities. For the real hidden gems, you’ll have to ask me in person.

One important reminder: **Please don’t take anything from the islands.** Even small actions like collecting sand, rocks, or shells can have a lasting impact on Hawaii's fragile ecosystems by speeding up erosion and affecting the natural beauty of the islands. Let’s preserve Hawaii’s magic so that future generations (our keiki) can experience it just as we have.

Mahalo, and have an unforgettable trip! 🌺
